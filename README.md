# The Writing on the Wall – Does This Apply to You?

In Daniel Chapter 5, King Belshazzar defied the Most High God by using sacred temple vessels for a drunken feast while praising false gods.

Suddenly, a mysterious hand appeared and wrote on the wall of the palace.

None of the astrologers or wise men of Babylon could interpret the message — but Daniel, servant of the Living God, revealed its meaning.

## The Message Interpreted

“MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN”

Daniel explained:

- God has numbered your kingdom and finished it.
- You have been weighed in the balances and found wanting.
- Your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians.

That very night, Belshazzar was slain.

## A Warning for All Humanity

Belshazzar had warnings.
He knew how God humbled Nebuchadnezzar.
Yet he rebelled.

The “writing on the wall” is a picture of divine judgment.

The Law of God stands as a handwriting against every sinner — declaring guilt and condemnation (Galatians 3:10).

## The Good News

Jesus Christ came to redeem us from the curse of the Law:

“Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us.” (Galatians 3:13)

Through His death on the cross:
- Our debt is paid
- The curse is lifted
- Eternal life is offered

Ephesians 2:15 reminds us that Christ abolished the law of commandments through His sacrifice.

## A Personal Question

Have you been weighed in the balances?

Are you trusting in your own works — or in the finished work of Christ?

Do not ignore the warning.
Run to Christ today and receive salvation.
